## Description

Social-Network-API is an API for a social network that uses a NoSQL database
so that the website can handle large amounts of unstructured data. I built this project because I wanted to learn how to use a database with unstructured data. I learned how to use compass and Insomnia to check and manipulate the Mongo database.
